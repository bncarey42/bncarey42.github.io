              I grew up in Ankeny, Iowa (not much more to say about that mostly kid stuff; band, choir, plays, scraped up my face falling off my bike in the neighbor’s driveway, elementary, middle, high schools, etc.). In 2009 I moved to Collegeville Minnesota for four years where I earned my bachelor’s degree in Theology at St. John’s University. (Again not much more to say other than college stuff; men’s choir, radio show, etc.)

              I've spent the last few years working as a volunteer coordinator for a couple of non-profit. First in Chicago at Saint James Food Pantry and then in Saint Cloud Minnesota for the Girl Scouts of Minnesota Lakes and Pines. Being one of the younger employees in both organizations I got pulled into IT and tech related projects quite often. I helped revamped automated volunteer tracking in both organizations with some mad Excel skills and also got some hands on time managing and developing websites for remote volunteer training.

              The more IT related projects I collaborated on the more I felt drawn to dedicate my time to learning more about IT and tech. Finally, in the fall of 2015 I decided to make a full switch to the IT world and enrolled at Saint Paul College to study for a certificate in web development. But as life would have it, I found that I had an aptitude for full stack software development and switched my certificate to my current line of study, an Associates in Applied Science in Computer Programming.

              I live in St. Paul, Minnesota with my wife, Leah. She teaches ESL for elementary students and is studying for her PhD in early childhood secondary language acquisition. She’s the smart one in our relationship. We love camping, Thai-takeout, hiking, Indian-takeout, summer days on the beaches near our apartment, Vietnamese-takeout, really nice coffee, craft/gluten-free beer, and takeout gluten-free Pizza. If you’re looking for more on my work check out the Work page up above to head over to my GitHub profile and take a look at my past projects for school and fun.
