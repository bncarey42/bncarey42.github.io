              <p>I grew up in Ankeny, Iowa and spent my college years at St. John’s University in Collegeville, Minnesota. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in theology, and was heavily involved in music and campus radio.

              I worked in volunteer management for the first few years out of college, including work at a food shelf pantry for a parish in Chicago, and for the Girl Scouts in Saint Cloud, Minnesota. Part of my role with the Girl Scouts involved training volunteers and collaborating with others on several projects. With this work, I soon became a point person for IT-related solutions. In addition, it became apparent that the way we organized our training, along with the tools and resources we used to train and work with others, needed some revamping. So, I worked on ways to automate the volunteer process and I developed websites for remote volunteer training.
              </p>
              <p>
              The more I became involved in IT and technical projects, I decided to learn more about avenues in which I could make IT my profession. In the Fall 2015, I began to work on an associates degree in computer science from St. Paul College. While completing my degree, I was able to gain valuable experience working on computer repairs and educating others about their devices as part of the Geek Squad. During my time at St. Paul College, I was able to engage with collaborative projects with peers and instructors, and become proficient in several programming languages. In June 2017, I started my position as an application developer with Securian Financial. I completed my computer science degree from St. Paul College in Fall, 2017.

              <h3>Personal Interests and Projects</h3>
              <p>Currently, I live in St. Paul with my partner, Leah. She is a former language teacher, and current instructor at the University of Minnesota in teacher education. She is also finishing her PhD in second language education. When we’re aren’t working or studying, we like to hike, travel, get take-out, try new breweries and distilleries and explore the cities.
