          <h4>Budgeting App</br>
            Personal Project - Ongoing
          </h4>
          <p>Early in learning Java I decided to test myself by building a rudimentary app to help determine
          a budget as laid out by a 50/30/20 model of personal budgeting in which: 50% of income is spent on
          essential expenditures, 30% is spent on obligatory expenditures, and 20% is spent on personal
          discretionary expenditures. Future plans for this app include an expanded GUI, increased capacity
          to track current progress in implementation of the determined budget, and ability to save and retrieve data from
            previous sessions in a more user friendly manner</p>
